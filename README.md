# multiconverter
convert values between different units from one form. E.g from Km to Metre, Inch to cm, kg to pounds, etc using the same form. The conversion is carried out using purely Javascript...
the HTML markup is contained in the index.php file
the conversion and swap operations are contained in the myscriptN.js file
the styling is in the mystyle.css file
the mini-project also makes use of bootstrap
